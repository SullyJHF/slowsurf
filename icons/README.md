# SlowSurf Icons

This directory should contain the following icon files for the Chrome extension:

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels (toolbar icon)
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels (extension management page)
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels (Chrome Web Store)

## Design Guidelines

The icons should represent the concept of "slowing down" or "taking time to think" before browsing. Suggested design elements:

- Clock or timer imagery
- Pause/stop symbols
- Gentle, calming colors (blues, greens)
- Simple, clean design that works at small sizes

## Creating Icons

You can create these icons using any graphics software or online icon generators. Make sure they are:

- PNG format
- Transparent background
- High quality at their respective sizes
- Consistent design across all sizes

## Temporary Note

For development purposes, you can use placeholder icons or the extension will work without them, though it won't have a custom icon in the Chrome toolbar.
